### What is the purpose of this repository?
To help give examples of rule-based AI through simple project code. 

### How to use/install clips?
You will first need the CLIPS ide and compiler which you can obtain through this [website](http://www.clipsrules.net/Downloads.html). For the time being, it appears to mainly work on Windows based OS's.
